           Hello guys! Welcome to my website! My name is Azeem khan! I'm a software engineering student who is passionate about programming and constantly learning new skills. While I've worked with several languages like Java, Python, and JavaScript, I understand that there's always more to learn.<br><br>

            Currently, I'm working towards becoming a full-stack developer, which means being proficient in both front-end and back-end development. On the front-end side, I have experience with creating responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also enjoy exploring popular frameworks like React and Angular.<br><br>
            
            On the backend side, I'm learning about database management systems (DBMS), data structures, algorithms, and open-source programming. I believe that understanding these concepts is essential for building robust and scalable applications. Additionally, I'm excited to dive into server-side programming languages like Node.js, Python, and Ruby.<br><br>
            
            On this website, you'll find some of my projects that I am working on and you can also work with me and improve my skills, and knowledge or for some fun. Whether you're a student, front-end developer or back-end developer, or a learner you all are welcome, I hope you'll find something here that interests you.<br><br>
            
            ltimately, my goal is to become a successful freelance full-stack developer. I enjoy working on diverse projects to deliver solutions. If you're interested in working with me or have any questions, feel free to reach out!<br><br>
